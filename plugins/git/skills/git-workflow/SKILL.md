# Git Workflow Best Practices

This skill provides guidelines for git operations including commits, conflict resolution, and branch management.

## Commit Guidelines

Use the `/git:commit` command or `git:commit-handler` agent.

## Splitting Changes into Multiple Commits

Use the `/git:commit-chunks` command.

## Conflict Resolution

Use the `/git:conflicts` command or `git:conflict-resolver` agent.

## Rebasing All Branches

Use the `/git:rebase-all` command.

## Worktree Management

Use the `/git:worktree` command for creating worktrees.

Use the `/git:clean-worktrees` command for cleaning up worktrees.
