âœ… Find and implement the next incomplete task from the project task list.

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Never use the Read tool on `.llm/todo.md`. Always use the `@markdown-tasks` skill.**

## Task context
The task list is in `.llm/todo.md`.

**IMPORTANT: Never use the Read tool on `.llm/todo.md`**. Always interact with the task list exclusively through the `@markdown-tasks` skill using the Python scripts described below. This ensures proper isolation and prevents context pollution.

The task format is:

```markdown
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[x]` - Completed
- `[>]` - In progress in a peer directory/worktree
- `[!]` - Blocked after multiple failed attempts
```

## Steps

- Find the next incomplete task
  - Use the `@markdown-tasks` skill to extract the first incomplete task from `.llm/todo.md`
  - Never read `.llm/todo.md` directly with the Read tool
  - The skill returns the first `Not started` task with all its context

- Implement the task
- Think hard about the plan
- Focus ONLY on implementing this specific task
- Ignore TODO/TASK comments in the source code
- Work through the implementation methodically and completely, addressing all aspects of the task
- Run appropriate tests and validation to ensure the implementation works

- When a code change is ready, and we are about to return control to the user, do these things in order:
  - Remove obvious comments using the @comment-cleaner agent
  - Verify the build passes using the @precommit-runner agent
  - Commit to git using the @git-commit-handler agent
  - Rebase on top of the upstream branch with the @git-rebaser agent

- âœ… Finally mark the task as complete:
  - Use the `@markdown-tasks` skill to mark the first incomplete task in `.llm/todo.md` as done
  - It changes the checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]`
